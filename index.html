        <h2>Beautiful Landscapes</h2>
        <p>Japan is known for its stunning landscapes, including cherry blossoms in spring, lush green mountains, and serene temples.</p>
        <p>Japan will amaze you with the diversity of its natural environment. The island stretches from north to south over 3000 kilometers; three quarters of it is mountainous, the rest consists of basins and plains.

            Japan has a mild climate and distinct seasonal changes. Because of its shape, the climate can vary greatly from place to place. For example, Hokkaido is known for its rigid and long winter, and ice drifts off its shores, while Okinawa is quiet, arid and belongs to the subtropical zone, with mangrove forests growing in many places.
            
            The island of Japan lies on four tectonic plates and it is the world's most geologically active zone. This is clear when observing the disposition of the islands, the many volcanoes, and hot springs welling up from underground. Volcanic activities also created the fuketsu, a cave where cold winds blow. Water is also ubiquitous: there are hundreds of rivers, deep lakes, and powerful waterfalls.
            
            Coastal areas are characterized by sandy beaches, bluffs, tidelands, and coral reefs. The sea surrounding the islands with warm and cold currents, is home to a huge variety of fish. There are about 6,000 islands, 430 of which are inhabited.</p>
